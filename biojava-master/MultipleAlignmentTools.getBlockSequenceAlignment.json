This method creates a sequence alignment where all residues\n * are in uppercase and a residue alone with gaps in all the other\n * structures represents unaligned residues.

For a sequence alignment of the full protein use\n * {@link #getSequenceAlignment(MultipleAlignment)}.\n * <p>\n * Blocks are concatenated in the order returned by\n * {@link MultipleAlignment#getBlocks()}, so sequences may not be\n * sequential. Gaps between blocks are omitted, while gaps within blocks are\n * represented by '-'. Separation between different Blocks is indicated by a\n * gap in all positions, meaning that there is something unaligned\n * inbetween.\n *\n * @param alignment\n *            input MultipleAlignment\n * @return String for each row in the alignment, giving the 1-letter code\n *         for each aligned residue.\n */\n","repo_name":"biojava-master/","id":656,"method_signature":"List<String> getBlockSequenceAlignment(MultipleAlignment)"}
